### **AI Call Center Agent**

#### **Project Overview**
The AI Call Center Agent is an intelligent, voice-activated assistant designed to automate customer support in a call center environment. Leveraging advanced AI technologies, this agent listens for a wake word, processes customer queries in real-time, and provides accurate responses using natural language processing. The agent is built to enhance efficiency, reduce operational costs, and improve customer satisfaction by handling routine inquiries, providing information, and guiding customers through complex processes.

#### **Key Features**
- **Voice Activation:** The agent continuously listens for a specific wake word ("Hey Agent") to initiate interaction, allowing for hands-free operation.
- **Asynchronous API Integration:** The agent integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate responses, ensuring quick and accurate answers to customer queries.
- **Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech:** Utilizing Google's Text-to-Speech (gTTS) and Speech Recognition libraries, the agent converts spoken language to text and generates natural-sounding voice responses.
- **Context Management:** Maintains conversation context across multiple interactions, ensuring a seamless and coherent customer experience.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Comprehensive error handling and logging ensure that the system remains reliable and issues are easily traceable.
- **Session Persistence:** The agent stores conversation history for later review and analysis, enabling continuous improvement and training.
- **Report Generation:** Automatically generates detailed reports summarizing interactions, including metrics such as response time, call duration, and customer satisfaction.

#### **Target Audience**
- **Customer Support Teams:** Organizations looking to automate routine customer service tasks, freeing up human agents for more complex inquiries.
- **Call Centers:** Businesses aiming to reduce operational costs and improve service levels by implementing AI-driven solutions.
- **SMBs (Small and Medium-sized Businesses):** Companies seeking scalable customer support solutions without the overhead of large support teams.
